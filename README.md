With our commitment to anytime/anywhere work, our support of flexible work environments, and our passion for health and wellness, GHJ wants people who live their best lives.

Family, friends, and personal passions all make us who we are. The work we do at GHJ is an extension of that. Having a rich, full, balanced life allows us to bring our best to our clients.

GHJ is made up of people who are athletes, parents, artists, yogis, travel-enthusiasts, community volunteers and more! We believe this makes us a firm that can #BeMore. And that’s the firm we want to be.

Client Accounting and Advisory Services
HOW DOES CAAS BENEFIT YOUR BUSINESS?

CAAS helps businesses fill any gaps in their finance function. With high-touch, personalized service options, businesses can expect a tailored package of services to level up their business.

    Budgeting, month-end closing and review sessions to ensure all financial reporting is up to date
    Data entry, reconciliations and bill pay to ensure books are kept up to date
    Market analysis, KPI tracking and modeling to ensure the company is on track to achieve desired financial goals

A PROVEN SOLUTION FOR HIGH-GROWTH TEAMS

GHJ’s team of experts can elevate any back office, whether the company is in need of data processing, cash flow forecasting, financial modeling or a combination of services. CAAS can collaborate with a company’s finance department or manage the entire finance function.

Working with GHJ’s CAAS professionals allows a company to support its key accounting functions on a temporary basis while in-between personal or long-term if the company is not ready to fill the role internally.

Clients can expect complete, accurate and timely management reports as well as guidance on accounting and finance best practices.

With decades of collective experience, they can handle a variety of finance functions and are an efficient solution for startups and other high-growth companies in need of finance support.
